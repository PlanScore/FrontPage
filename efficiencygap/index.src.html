        <h1>Efficiency Gap</h1>
        <p>Efficiency Gap (EG) shows relative wasted votes between parties, comparing the total statewide number of superfluous and losing votes for each party. A high EG score happens when one party’s votes are wasted at a higher rate than the other’s, forcing them to earn more votes to win the same number of districts as they would under a fair plan. The EG score counts two kinds of wasted votes under a plan: those in excess of 51% for a district winner and those for a district loser.</p>
        <p>The EG metric was proposed by Nicholas O. Stephanopoulos and Eric M. McGhee in their 2015 University of Chicago Law Review paper, <em><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/Stephanopoulos_McGhee_Efficiency_Gap_2015.pdf" target="_blank">Partisan Gerrymandering and the Efficiency Gap</a></em>.</p>
