            This article provides an initial overview of the new Congressional and
            state legislative districts being drawn around the country. We provide
            background on the redistricting land- scape, including changes in
            scholarsâ€™ ability to measure partisan gerrymandering, the chang- ing
            role of federalism, and the Voting Rights Act. We also discuss the
            process used to draw the new districts in each state. We then provide
            an empirical look at partisan fairness, com- petiveness, and minority
            representation on the new plans. We find that both parties have
            continued to enact more and more extreme partisan gerrymanders when
            they control the redistricting process. The combination of Republicansâ€™
            control of the redistricting process in far more states than Democrats
            and the inefficient concentration of Democrats in cities has enabled
            Republcians to largely maintain an advantage in the translation of
            votes to seats in both Congress and many state legislatures. As a
            result, the policymaking process in many states will continue to be
            skewed in a conservative direction. At the same time, nonpartisan
            Commissions appear to be leading to less biased and more competitive
            maps. Finally, we conclude by discussing lessons for both scholars and
            advocates.
