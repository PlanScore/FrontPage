        <h1>Declination</h1>
        <p>A gerrymander purposefully designs districts around the win/loss threshold to ensure that more districts of the favored party end up on the winning side. A neutral map, by contrast, designs the districts for other reasons and does not treat the win/loss threshold as particularly special. Declination uses this fact by capturing asymmetry around the threshold, as in the plot below.</p>
        <p><img src="/images/declination-unfair-example.png" width="100%" alt="Declination graph showing unfair example"></p>
        <p>The declination metric treats asymmetry in the distribution of votes across districts as indicative of partisan bias in a districting plan. To calculate declination, we take the angles of the lines between each party’s mean vote share in the districts they won and the point on the 50% line between the mass of points representing each party. We then take the difference between those two angles and divide by π/2 to convert the result from radians to fractions of 90 degrees. We then do a further adjustment to account for differences in the number of seats across legislative chambers.</p>
        <p>For more about declination, see Gregory Warrington's Election Law Journal article, <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/elj.2017.0447"><i>Quantifying Gerrymandering Using the Vote Distribution</i></a> and paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04799"><i>Introduction to the Declination Function for Gerrymanders</i></a>.</p>
        <p>Compare declination to three other metrics, <a href="/metrics/partisanbias/">partisan bias</a>, <a href="/metrics/meanmedian/">mean-median difference</a>, and the <a href="/metrics/efficiencygap/">efficiency gap</a>.</p>
