      <h1>Efficiency Gap</h1>
      <p>Partisan gerrymandering is always carried out by cracking a party&rsquo;s supporters among many districts, in which their preferred candidates lose by relatively narrow margins; and/or by packing a party&rsquo;s backers in a few districts, in which their preferred candidates win by enormous margins. Both cracking and packing produce votes that are inefficient in the sense that they do not contribute to a candidate&rsquo;s election. In the case of cracking, all votes cast for the losing candidate are inefficient. In the case of packing, all votes cast for the winning candidate, above the 50% (plus one) threshold needed for victory, are inefficient. The efficiency gap is calculated by taking one party&rsquo;s total inefficient votes in an election, subtracting the other party&rsquo;s total inefficient votes, and dividing by the total number of votes cast. It captures in a single number the extent to which district lines crack and pack one party&rsquo;s voters more than the other party&rsquo;s voters.</p>

      <p>The efficiency gap was introduced by Nicholas Stephanopoulos and Eric McGhee in their 2015 University of Chicago Law Review article, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2457468"><i>Partisan Gerrymandering and the Efficiency Gap</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Compare the efficiency gap to two other metrics, <a href="/metrics/partisanbias/">partisan bias</a> and the <a href="/metrics/meanmedian/">mean-median difference</a>.</p>
