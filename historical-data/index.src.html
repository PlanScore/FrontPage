        <h1>Historical Data</h1>
        
        <p>
        PlanScore’s historical data presents estimates of efficiency gap, partisan bias, and mean-median difference for legislative district plans stretching back to 1972. Nicholas Stephanopoulos, Eric McGhee, and Simon Jackman collected, calculated, and presented this data for several partisan gerrymandering court cases. <a href="http://klarnerpolitics.com/kp-dataset-page.html">Carl E. Klarner</a> (Indiana State University and Harvard University) provided historical vote counts.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Not all states and years are included in PlanScore’s historical data.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Some states drop out of the analysis entirely, because of exceedingly high rates of uncontested races, using multi-member districts, non-partisan elections, or the use of a run-off system. Some states do not supply data over the entire 1972-2014 span; this is sometimes due to earlier elections being subject to exceedingly high rates of uncontestedness, the use of multi-member districts or non-partisan elections. Data is more abundant in recent decades.
