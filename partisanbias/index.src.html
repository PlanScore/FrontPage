        <h1>Partisan Bias</h1>
        <p>Partisan bias is the difference between each party&rsquo;s seat share and 50% in a hypothetical, perfectly tied election. For example, if a party would win 55% of a plan&rsquo;s districts if it received 50% of the statewide vote, then the plan would have a bias of 5% in this party&rsquo;s favor. To calculate partisan bias, the observed vote share in each district is shifted by the amount necessary to simulate a tied statewide election. Each party&rsquo;s seat share in this hypothetical election is then determined. The difference between each party&rsquo;s seat share and 50% is partisan bias.</p>
        <p>For more about partisan bias, see Bernard Grofman and Gary Kingâ€™s 2007 Election Law Journal article, <a href="https://gking.harvard.edu/files/jp.pdf"><i>The Future of Partisan Symmetry as a Judicial Test for Partisan Gerrymandering After LULAC v. Perry</i></a>.</p>
