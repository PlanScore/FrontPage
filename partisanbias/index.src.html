        <h1>Partisan Bias</h1>
        <p>Partisan Bias (PB) shows how much a system unfairly favors a single party, comparing the number of votes cast in an election to the number of legislative seats won. A high PB score results when one party is able to consistently convert votes into district victories at a higher rate than they would under a symmetrical plan, even winning a majority of districts despite earning half the votes in a competitive 50/50 election. </p>
        <p>The PB score was proposed by Andrew Gelman and Gary King in their 1994 American Journal of Political Science paper, <em><a href="https://gking.harvard.edu/files/abs/writeit-abs.shtml" target="_blank">A Unified Method of Evaluating Electoral Systems and Redistricting Plans</a></em>.</p>
