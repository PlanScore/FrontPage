        <h1>Mean/Median Metric</h1>
        <p>Mean/Median (MM) shows partisan packing by a majority party, comparing the party’s vote share in the state’s deciding median district to its overall state share. A large MM score suggest potential harm, but it may also happen naturally. Actual harm can be shown where the MM score shows a party consistently winning a majority of votes but failing to win a majority of districts.</p>
        <p>The MM score was proposed by Michael D. McDonald and Robin E. Best in their 2015 Election Law Journal article, <em> <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/McDonald_Best_Unfair_Gerrymanders_2015.pdf" target="_blank">Unfair Partisan Gerrymanders in Politics and Law: A Diagnostic Applied to Six Cases</a></em>.</p>
